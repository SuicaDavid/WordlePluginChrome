# Wordle Extension

Due to the high amount of wordle spam mess from my friend, I would like to build some tools to destroy their experience. First I develop a website to hint the possible answers when the user inputs the word and its colour. It is so cumber for the users and they absolutely don't want to use the website. For that reason, I developed this extension to force them to install. Once install forever destroy.

However, the only problem is that I need to pay **5 dollars** for the developer fee of Google Web Store. I am currently in the condition of homeless. That reason daunts me to submit further.
